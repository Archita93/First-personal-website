    <h2> <strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
    <hr size = "5" color = "darkblue">
    
    <p>
       I am a Computing Science major, studying in Simon Fraser University. I am interested in pursuing research in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Although, I am a complete beginner in my major, I aspire to make use of all of my knowledge that I gain and the experience I attain throughout my programming journey for the benefit of Humankind in the forseeable future.
       Apart from my professional interests, I really enjoy going for a run or using the gym as it allows me to be physically and mentally active. I am generally a very considerate individual who strongly believes in her ideas and opinions and is confident enough to make a stand for herself. 
       Anyway, it is my pleasure to have you on my website, in order to contact me, you can reach me with my <a href = "Contact list.html">contact list</a>.
